Causal App is a local Streamlit tool for running causal discovery algorithms. To use it, first install Graphviz from https://graphviz.org/download/ and check “Add Graphviz to PATH”. Verify the installation with: dot -V. Then install all Python dependencies (Python 3.11 recommended) using: pip install -r requirements.txt. Once the dependencies are installed, launch the application from the project directory with: streamlit run app.py. The interface will open at http://localhost:8501 and all computations will run locally on your machine.
